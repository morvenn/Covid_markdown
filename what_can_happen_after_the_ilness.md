What can happen after the illness?
=================================

Most patients recover from COVID-19 and return to normal activities, but for some, especially those with a severe infection, symptoms may persist for weeks or even months.

Older people and those with co-morbidities are most at risk of persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Occasionally, even young people who have not been hospitalised for COVID-19 infection because they had a mild course of the disease may experience persistent or late symptoms - these may appear even after initial recovery.

COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for up to several months. The virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, increasing the risk of long-term health problems. Therefore, the topic of caring for so-called post-COVID-19 patients (so-called recovering patients) who have survived the infection at home or in hospital is increasingly being addressed. There is now a growing awareness of the distant consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

# What should you do if you are still feeling the effects of the infection?

According to experts, in the care of the post-covid patient, the role of the pulmonologist is very important, to assess the presence of pulmonary complications and the continuation of cardiac treatment.

It is important to note that post-COVID patients are not only those who need time to recover from their stay in the intensive care unit, but also young people, including those who were physically fit before SARS-CoV-2 infection, who have passed the disease mildly but report late symptoms of the disease.

So far there are no guidelines, neither in Poland nor in the world, on how to treat this group of patients. Only materials or expert recommendations concerning rehabilitation of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 have appeared.
