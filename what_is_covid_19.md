What is COVID-19
================

COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus (commonly known as coronavirus). It was first recognized and described in November 2019, in central China (Wuhan city, Hubei province) during a series of cases that initiated a pandemic of the disease.

Infection is spread between people mainly by the droplet route, usually through coughing or sneezing. The incubation period of the disease usually ranges from 2 to 14 days, with an average of 5 days. Sick people can become infected 24-48 hours before the onset of symptoms.

[The World Health Organisation's position](https://www.who.int/) puts the case fatality rate (CFR - the number of deaths per registered case of disease) at 3.4%. On 30 January 2020, WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern as a result of the spreading COVID-19 outbreak. On 11 March 2020, WHO declared the series of COVID-19 cases occurring since November 2019 as a pandemic.
