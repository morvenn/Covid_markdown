COVID-19 vaccine - characteristics and types
===========================================

Developing a new vaccine is a long and complex process. Each vaccine formulation must successfully pass through successive stages of laboratory testing, preclinical animal studies and human clinical trials.

Research on the COVID-19 vaccine began as soon as the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was published (11 January, 2020). The humanitarian and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a great motivation for the researchers to work, so that the first vaccine prototypes were ready to start human clinical trials already in mid-March 2020.

**There are 3 types of vaccine:** mRNA, vector and subunit vaccines.

Until now (April 2021), two mRNA vaccines (from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna) and one vector vaccine (from AstraZeneca) have been licensed in EU countries. These vaccines protect against COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The vaccination involves the administration of 2 doses intramuscularly. On 11 March, 2021, The European Medicines AgencyClosed (EMA)[^1] also issued a positive opinion on the vaccine from Janssen Pharmaceutica, part of Johnson & Johnson. The product has been approved for use in European Union countries.

Protection appears between 7 and 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. The vaccine's high efficacy in protecting against COVID-19 has been confirmed in large clinical trials, which also included people with concomitant diseases.
