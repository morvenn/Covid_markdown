Masks
=====

Masks can help prevent the transmission of viruses from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19 - you should also keep your distance from other people and take care with hand hygiene. Follow the recommendations of your local health and epidemiological station.

There are many types of masks you can use to protect yourself and others from getting and spreading COVID-19. When choosing a mask, choose one that fits snugly. Available types of masks:

* Cloth masks (made from a variety of fabrics)
* Disposable face masks
* KN95 masks (type of filtering facepiece respirator)

Masks are a critical step to help prevent people from getting and spreading COVID-19. A cloth mask offers some protection to you as well as protecting those around you. Wear a mask and take every day preventive actions in public settings and mass transportation, at events and gatherings, and anywhere you will be around other people.
