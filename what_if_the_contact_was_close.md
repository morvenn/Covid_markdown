What if the contact was close?
=============================

First of all - don't panic.

* If the contact with the infected person was closer than 2 metres and longer than 15 minutes (being in the same room, direct conversation),
* If there was physical contact (e.g. shaking hands, touching a used tissue, exposure to coughing),

...there is a greater likelihood of infection.

In this situation:

* Report to the sanitary-epidemiological station.

* Stay at home until you receive the decision to impose quarantine[^1].The sanitary-epidemiological station communicates it to you by telephone or via an automatic quarantine notification.

* Install the mandatory [Home Quarantine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.nask.droid.kwarantannadomowa) application when you receive the notification.

**Important!** Your household members are not quarantined in this situation.
