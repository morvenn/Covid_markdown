If you get request for a COVID-19 test
======================================

Referring for a test by your GP changes your situation. A negative result automatically ends the quarantine[^1]. A positive result means infection and isolation. In this situation your housemates have to be quarantined.

[^1]: A restriction on the movement of people, animals and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a communicable disease, yet do not have a confirmed medical diagnosis.
