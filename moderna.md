Moderna vaccine
==============

The most commonly reported adverse reactions were:

* pain at the injection site (92%),
* fatigue (70%),
* headache (64.7%),
* muscle pain (61.5%),
* joint pain (46.4%),
* chills (45.4%),
* nausea/vomiting (23%),
* swelling/ tenderness in the armpit (19.8%),
* fever (15.5%),
* swelling at injection site (14.7%),
* redness (10%).

Most of these local and systemic adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower incidence of reactogenicity events was associated with older age of participants.

Overall, some adverse reactions were more common in younger age groups: the incidence of armpit swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to 65 years than in those aged 65 years and older. Local and systemic adverse reactions were reported more frequently with Dose 2 than with Dose 1.
