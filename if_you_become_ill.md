If you become ill
=================

* Inform the sanitary-epidemiological station[^1].
* Get tested:
  * You can sign up for the test online. Just fill in the form available here. Answer a few questions. Based on the data you have provided, the system determines whether you are eligible for the test.
  * If you have symptoms indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection, your primary care doctor will issue an electronic referral for a free test. You receive information about mobile collection points, known as drive thru centres, where you can take the test. There, without getting out of the car, a nurse takes a nasopharyngeal swab[^2].
  * If the patient is not fully self-sufficient, the doctor informs the sanitary-epidemiological station by telephone. The station issues a test order and sends an ambulance. The paramedics in the ambulance test the patient.

* Isolate yourself - stay at home.
* Call 112 or 999[^3] if your condition gets worse.
