To prevent the spread of COVID-19
=================================

* Wash your hands frequently - at least several times a day and every time you come home from outdoors. Use soapy water and an alcohol-based disinfectant.
* Keep a safe distance (1,5 - 2 metres) from people coughing and sneezing.
* Wear a mask when distance is not possible.
* Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
* When you cough or sneeze, cover your nose and mouth with the inside of your elbow or a tissue.
* If you feel unwell, stay at home.
* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, contact your doctor.

For a quick referral to the right medical facility, call your nearest GP surgery in advance. This ensures you are protected and prevents the spread of viruses and other infectious agents.
