What to do after contact with a person infected with COVID-19?
==============================================================

Inform The Social Insurance Institution[^1] by telephone about the quarantine[^2], and they should do the rest. You do not need an electronic sick note or a certificate from the health authorities. However, it is worth notifying your boss by e-mail or telephone of the reason for your absence from work.

If, however, there is no information for your employer in the system - make a statement about being in quarantine. You have 3 days from the end of the quarantine to do this.

The statement should include some essential information:

* Your personal details (name, PESEL[^3] number, ID card or passport series and number),
* The day the compulsory quarantine started and the day it ended,
* Your signature.

If you have no symptoms, you will end the quarantine after 10 days.

Remember to monitor how you feel. If you feel worse and have symptoms of COVID-19 - call your GP. They will assess your health and make a referral for testing if necessary.
