COMIRNATY vaccine (from BioNTech and Pfizer)
===========================================

The most common adverse reactions in participants aged 16 years or older were:

* injection site pain (>80%),
* fatigue (>60%),
* headache (>50%),
* muscle pain and chills (>30%),
* joint pain (>20%),
* fever and swelling at the injection site (>10%).

These events were usually mild to moderate in severity and resolved within a few days of vaccine administration. A slightly lower incidence of reactogenicity events was associated with more advanced age.
