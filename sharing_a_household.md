What if someone you share a household with falls ill?
====================================================

* Ideally, a COVID-19 patient should have their own separate room with a bathroom and toilet.
* [Masks](masks.md) should be worn by all family members including the patient.
* Frequent washing or disinfection of hands and disinfection of objects and shared surfaces is very important.
* Ventilate your home as often as possible, but avoid the use of fans, air conditioners and air purifiers.
