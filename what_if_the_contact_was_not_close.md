What if the contact was not close?
==================================

Try to remember the situation in which you came into contact with a sick person. If the contact was brief, from a distance of more than 2 metres, the risk of infection is low. In this case, keep an eye on your health, take care of yourself and behave in a safe manner. You do not have to go into quarantine[^1].

[^1]: A restriction on the movement of people, animals and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a communicable disease, yet do not have a confirmed medical diagnosis.
